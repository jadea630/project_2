1. Sometimes, dictionaty and list of dictionary cannot give to a new variable. 

2. The theory is not easy to understand, and taking many to read resouces. Our problem is that We cannot get whole domain name at question part and answer part. I try to solve it, but the time is not enough.

1. I found this project very dificult, although I was able to understand the conceptual aspect of the project (somewhat), my project partner and I were unable to fully implement some features. We were unable to grab the domain name properly, for some reason it kept cutting off the beginning of the domain name. If this were successful I believe we would of been able to move forward, as the rest of our code follows the algorithms steps. 

2. The hardest part of this project was trying to debug it, althought I felt that I had somewhat of a grasp on it, testing was difficult and I wasted so much time trying to fix small errors just to try and get to the bigger picture. This is upsetting because I feel I did very well on the last two projects but this one slipped away from me. I started this project roughly 4 days after it was assigned, so everyday for ~4 hours I made progress on it after I got out of work, I believe my new job severly impacted my ability and I regret getting a new job in the middle of this class.
